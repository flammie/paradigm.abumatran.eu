** Paradigm Annotation Tool **

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Software requirements
--------------------

You will need Python, Apache 2, PHP 5 and a MySql database client and server with the following additional modules: php5-mysql, python-webpy, python-mysqldb (Ubuntu packages)


Database initialization
-----------------------

Enter MySql console and execute the following commands in order to create the database and the user for the paradigm annotation tool:

create database paradigm;
GRANT ALL ON paradigm.* TO 'paradigm_admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'paradigmadmin';

Then import the dump included in the package (this example assumes your MySql user is root and there is no password):

mysql -u root -p paradigm  < paradigm_database_dump_nodata.sql

This will initialize an empty database with the required structure.


Apache website configuration
----------------------------

Copy the directory paradigm.abumatran.eu to /var/www/. Then, copy the file 009-paradigm.abumatran.eu.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. In order to test that everything works, you can edit the file /etc/hosts to make your system redirect paradigm.abumatran.eu to localhost.


Running the system
--------------------

Finally, initialize the python servers with the following commands:

paradigm/server/user/run.py 59999 &> /home/rafa/paradigm/server/user/logserver &
paradigm/server/task/run.py 59998 &> /home/rafa/paradigm/server/task/logserver &


Adding users and tasks
----------------------

You can insert new tasks from Json files (a Json sample is included) with the python script parseJsonForMysql.simpleJson.py

Then you can create users and assign them to tasks from paradigm.abumatran.eu/admin/. Administration section users are defined in /var/www/paradigm.abumatran.eu/admin/.htpasswd. Once you have created the desired users, you can start annotating by goinf to paradigm.abumatran.eu.
